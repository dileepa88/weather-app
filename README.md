# weather-app MVVM

**Overview**
This is a sample project demonstrating the use of SwiftUI along with the MVVM architecture. The app serves as a foundation for understanding how to structure and implement a scalable, maintainable, and testable iOS app.

This imple demo app focused on providing weather information for cities. The app allows users to search for cities and view detailed weather information for the selected location.

**Features**

Swift UI: Utilizes the Swift UI framework for building a modern and declarative user interface.

MVVM Architecture: Implements the Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern to separate concerns, enhance code organization, and facilitate unit testing.

Unit Testing: Includes XCUnit tests to ensure individual components and functions work as expected, 100% code coverage for ViewModels and non-UI codes.

UI Testing: Incorporates XCUI tests to verify the app's user interface and overall behavior.

Network Layer with Data Mocking: Implements a networking layer for fetching data from a remote server. Mocks data for unit tests, to showcase how the datamocking is achived.
